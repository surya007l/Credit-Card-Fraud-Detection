This project explores various supervised classification algorithms to accurately identify fraudulent activities. ## 📌 Table of Contents - [Overview](#overview) - [Dataset](#dataset) - [Technologies Used](#technologies-used) - [Project Structure](#project-structure) - [Model Performance](#model-performance) - [Installation](#installation) - [Usage](#usage) - [Future Work](#future-work) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [License](#license) --- ## 📖 Overview Credit card fraud is a serious issue that results in billions of dollars of losses annually. This project uses machine learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Since fraud cases are extremely rare, the dataset is highly imbalanced, and careful techniques are used to handle this. The objective is to: - Detect fraudulent transactions. - Improve model performance using data preprocessing and feature engineering. - Use evaluation metrics suited for imbalanced datasets. --- ## 📊 Dataset The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) available on Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. - **Total Transactions**: 284,807 - **Fraudulent Transactions**: 492 (0.172%) - **Features**: 30 (anonymized for privacy; includes PCA components V1-V28, Time, Amount, and Class) --- ## 🛠 Technologies Used - Python - Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing) - Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation) - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization) - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab --- ## 📁 Project Structure ``` credit-card-fraud-detection/ │ ├── data/ # Dataset files (not uploaded due to size/privacy) ├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training │ ├── eda.ipynb │ └── model_training.ipynb ├── src/ # Core source code │ ├── preprocessing.py │ ├── model.py │ └── utils.py ├── requirements.txt # Required Python packages ├── README.md # Project documentation └── results/ # Plots and performance metrics ``` --- ## 🧠 Model Performance After evaluating multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), the following metrics were considered: - **Precision** - **Recall** - **F1-Score** - **ROC-AUC Score** - **Confusion Matrix** **Best Performing Model: Random Forest** - Precision: 0.91 - Recall: 0.86 - F1 Score: 0.88 - ROC AUC: 0.97 --- ## 🔧 Installation ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git cd credit-card-fraud-detection pip install -r requirements.txt ``` --- ## 🚀 Usage 1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` folder. 2. Run the Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training: ```bash jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb ``` 3. Evaluate the predictions and visualize metrics. --- ## 🌱 Future Work - Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI - Build a dashboard for real-time fraud detection - Try deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders, LSTM) - Implement model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) --- ## 🤝 Contributing Contributions are welcome!
