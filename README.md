ðŸ“– Overview
Credit card fraud is a serious issue that results in billions of dollars of losses annually. This project uses machine learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Since fraud cases are extremely rare, the dataset is highly imbalanced, and careful techniques are used to handle this.

The objective is to:

Detect fraudulent transactions.

Improve model performance using data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Use evaluation metrics suited for imbalanced datasets.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Total Transactions: 284,807

Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.172%)

Features: 30 (anonymized for privacy; includes PCA components V1-V28, Time, Amount, and Class)

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

Scikit-learn (Modelling & Evaluation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
